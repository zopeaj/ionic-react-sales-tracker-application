# Ionic React Conference Application


This application is purely a kitchen-sink demo of the Ionic Framework and React.

**There is not an actual Ionic Conference at this time.** This project is just to show off Ionic components in a real-world application.

## Angular and Vue versions

We've built versions of this Conference app in Angular and Vue for developers that would prefer to use one of those framework options:
